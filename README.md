Week 6 Activity - Comparing accuracy rate


SVM accuracy: 97.33%

K Means accuracy: 88.7%

C50 accuracy: 93.33% 

- C5.0 is a decision tree algorithm used for classification tasks where the tree is built by dividing the dataset into subsets based on the most informative attributes 
- K-means is a clustering algorithm for partitioning data into groups to minimize the sum of squared distances between points and their cluster centroids.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm used to find a hyperplane that best separates data into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes.
